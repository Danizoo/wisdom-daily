    "explanation": "King emphasizes the **vital importance of speaking up against injustice and for one's beliefs**. Silence in the face of what is morally wrong or profoundly significant is not neutral; it is a form of complicity that diminishes one's own humanity and the possibility of positive change.

    "apply": "Throughout the day, notice when you're tempted to stay silent—especially in conversations that touch on values, fairness, or difficult truths. If something stirs your conscience, challenge yourself to speak up, even if it’s uncomfortable. That could mean expressing concern when someone’s being treated unfairly, standing up for what you believe in, or simply sharing an honest opinion that matters. Avoid the trap of indifference. Silence, in the face of injustice or wrong, chips away at your own vitality. Your voice is a tool for change—don’t withhold it when it’s needed. Courage is often quiet, but impactful.",
